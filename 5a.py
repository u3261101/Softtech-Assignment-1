Write a GUI program that asks the user to enter the number of times that they have run around 
a racetrack, and then uses a loop to prompt them to enter the lap time for each of their laps. 
When the loop finishes, the program should display the time  of their  fastest lap, the time of 
their slowest lap, and their average lap time
