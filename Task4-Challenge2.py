'''
A nutritionist who works for a fitness club helps members by evaluating their diets. As part of her evaluation, 
she asks members for the number of fat grams and carbohydrate grams that they consumed in a day. Then, 
she calculates the number of calories that result from the fat, using the following formula: 
calories from fat =  fat grams x 3.9
Next, she calculates the number of calories that result from the carbohydrates, using the following formula: 
calories from carbs = carb grams x 4 
The nutritionist asks you to write a GUI program that will make these calculations
